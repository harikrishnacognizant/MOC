        <h2>Customizing the columns</h2>
        <p>All of the left and right columns have been created so that you can either have one continues box that goes all the way to the bottom, or several different boxes in each column, however you like it.  To make multiple columns, <strong>select the divs 'leftcol' and 'leftcol_bottom'</strong>, copy, and paste the below the current ones (still inside of the 'leftcol_container' div).   This will create an exact copy of your column directly underneath your current one.  The left menu is an example of a long single div, while the right is multiple divs using the above method. 
        <p>   This process is exactly the same for the main column (replace 'maincol' for 'leftcol') and the right as well ('rightcol' instead of 'leftcol').  The site looks good either way you do it, so experiment around with what works best for you.  The box below this one shows what an additional main column looks like (as opposed to a long single one)

        <h2>More Template Information</h2>
        <p>If you want to change the picture at the top to something else, the easiest way to do this would be to overwrite the current image (located at: /images/picture.jpg) with your own JPEG image.  Just make sure to keep the same dimensions of 900x237.  The headings in all the columns are &lt;h2&gt; tags, and are automatically formatted for you.</p>
